# Project Name: Driving School Management Assessment Project
This file contains the SQL code for a driving school management assessment for the 'Database Systems' module, completed at the University of Kent (UKC). The project involves creating tables for a driving school database, inserting sample data, and executing queries to retrieve specific information.

## Project Description
The project manages a driving school's database, including information about clients, instructors, lessons, tests, administrative staff, cars, centres, and schools. The SQL code provided in this repository sets up the database schema, inserts sample data, and demonstrates various queries to retrieve relevant information.
